# Conducta
Conducta is an event permission seeking automation webapp for Campuses. Students can create new request to conduct an event in the campus and the request first verifies the sender then it seeks permission from each member of the authority finally grants the permission to conduct the event. Authorities can deny permission and student can track the status of the request using their private id.
